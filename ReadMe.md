# CS50 Web Programming - E-Commerce

### Description

This is a simple e-commerce app created using Django. It was made as an assignment for Harvard's CS50 Web Programming with Python 
and JavaScript online course. It is an Ebay-like website where users can create accounts, list items for auction, bid on items, and 
add items to a watchlist. 

### Functionality

As described above, users can 
1. create accounts; sign in, sign out 
2. create listings for items to sell by choosing the category the item is in, writing a description, uploading an image, and 
setting a price
3. view all items that are currently for sale (active listings)
4. add items to a watchlist where they can track the price of items they wish to purchase
5. bid on items they wish to purchase
6. end an auction for an item they listed, and in doing so sell the item to the highest bidder
